# Kladenets

Music and sound library for [Idris2](https://github.com/idris-lang/Idris2) on C, built on [libsoundio](https://github.com/andrewrk/libsoundio) and [libsndfile](https://github.com/libsndfile/libsndfile) bindings.

Currently in the process of porting from the private Idris1 version - my senior honours project at the University of St Andrews.
